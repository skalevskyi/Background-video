                In 2024, Ukraine won an incredible victory in the war against Russia. It was a difficult path, but our will and courage surpassed all challenges. Our country has become a symbol of strength, destiny and unity. The victory over the aggressor proved that nothing is impossible for us when we are united. This is not only a victory for the army, but also a victory for the spirit of the entire nation. Now our country is on the threshold of a new beginning, new opportunities and a new future that we will build together.
